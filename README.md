***TO-DOs***
- Identify a lead vocal (john, paul, george, or ringo) - SINGER IDENTIFICATION
  - Use unsupervised learning to distinguish the vocals. Is it possible with spectral features?
  - Of course you can train a ML/DL model on the whole Beatles vocal data and test to identify the vocals. But it's too common thing.
- Analyze drums patterns
- Draw a lyric map
- Melody extraction and key detection on vocals
- ... and I'll come up with more ideas.
